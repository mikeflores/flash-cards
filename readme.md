# Flash Cards
Decks of cards for fun and frivolity

## User Stories
As a user, I want to:
    
1. choose a deck to play
2. move through the cards in the deck
3. see how many I got right and wrong
4. set a timer for each card (feature)
5. see the cards flip horizontally (design feature)

## Approach
- I wrote out [pseudocode](planning.md) to carefully plan what I wanted to accomplish. My goal with the pseudocode was to break down the pieces of the project into their smallest parts. This took me a 2-4 hours.
- Next, I wrote some structured HTML and CSS to give myself a starting point.
- Next, I was advised to start with making the card work
- From there, I found more things to work on and was able to identify what exactly I could accomplish.
- My MVP features were:
    - getting the card with both term and definition to work
    - moving back and forth through the deck
    - setting up a grading system to count my correct and incorrect answers
- I was not able to get to:
    - a timing feature that would allow for a countdown per card. A lot more features could have been developed with "time" as a factor. I hope to explore and build this more.
    - getting the cards to actually flip to give the user the neat experience

## Documentation
Check out my [Planning Documentation](planning.md) (pseudocode) for this build.
